## Class President Voting System
A Class President Voting System needs to be written in C++ and do the following, as indicated in project instructions:
- 	Display the four candidates running for Class President:
    -	John Parker
    - Jane Smith
    - Alice Johnson
    - Bob Williams
- 	Prompt the user to enter the number of students that will be voting.
-	A vote for a candidate must be cast by entering a number (1, 2, 3, or 4), based on the candidate list.
-	The votes should be counted for each candidate and displayed (only valid votes).
-	The program will display the winner or indicate the case where a tie occurred.

## Multi-Converter App
A Multi-Converter App for a friend from the United states needs to be written in C++ and do the following, as indicated in project instructions:
- A menu needs to display with conversion options:
    - Temperature
    - Currency
    - Speed
- The user must enter a value to be converted:
- Temperature: Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- Currency: USD to ZAR, where 1USD = 18.5ZAR.
- Speed: mph to km/h.
- The result of the conversion needs to be displayed.
- The program must allow for multiple conversion by asking the user if they would like to do another conversion. Should the user not want to do another conversion, the user can exit the program.
